# Linked-List-Dictionary
Dictionary using c, that takes in a sentence from the user and puts each word in its own node, sorts dictionary alphabetically by manipulating the next pointers of the nodes, nodes storing the name of the word, length of the word, and position in the linked list.
To end the sentence simply put a " z " at the end of the sentence, for example: "the mouse ran over the grass z" or "cats in the flowers z" just to let the program know when the sentence ends and to intiate the nodes with each word.
Dictionary will be displayed in the format: word[length][position], where length is the length of the word, and position is the position inside the linked list.
